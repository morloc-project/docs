You will need to install very old versions of `asciidoctor`,
`asciidoctor-bibtex` and `asciidoctor-latex`.

Try these commands:

```
gem install asciidoctor -v 1.5.2
gem install asciidoctor-bibtex -v 0.1.0
gem install pygments.rb
gem install asciidoctor-latex --pre
make
```

If that doesn't work, panic.
