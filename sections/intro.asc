We make toys underground and give them to the people who live above. We tend
the machines so they don't have to. We would never, ever eat the them. So what
are you waiting for? Descend into the underdark and create with us!

=== Mission

Morloc is a framework that allows interoperability between functions across
languages, multi-language libraries and package managers, and encoding of
domain specific behavior into the type system. Based on this framework, we will
build a community portal for curating a universal library. Any public functions
in this library can be used in any Morloc script. They may also be imported
into specific languages and used.

We accomplish this by providing

 1. a framework for passing rich data between languages
 2. a common library across languages
 3. a common meta-programming language
