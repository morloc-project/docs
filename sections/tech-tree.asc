== Tech Tree

The purpose of this document is to describe the underlying Haskell packages
that are used in `morloc`. It is not intended to act as a replacement for the
documentation of the packages themselves, but rather describes how they are
used within the `morloc` context and why they were chosen.

=== `wl-pprint-text`

Parsers such as `parsec` and `megaparsec` take strings and turn them into
structures. The dreadfully named `wl-pprint-text` does the reverse. There is
a beautiful symmetry between the syntax for `wl-pprint-text` and `parsec`.
Commands in `parsec` that parse a string into a list (e.g., `many digit`) and
reversed by `hsep` that takes a list of Doc types and makes a new Doc.

What is this Doc things? Apart from the beauty of `wl-pprint-text`, it is also
highly performant. The `wl` is a reference to Wadler cite:[wadler2003prettier]
and Leijen cite:[leijen2006pprint], the authors of the paper on a
high-performance, combinator-based pretty printer.

`wl-pprint-text` is a translation of `wl-pprint` from using String to using
Text, for greater performance.

=== `megaparsec`

`megaparsec` is an industrial strength alternative to `parsec`.
