[NOTE]
This document is cobbled together from loose informal notes, fragments of a
stuffy academic paper, and purple prose from an NSF grant. Much of what is
written here has not yet been implemented. What has been implemented is likely
to be radically redone in the near future.

Morloc is a framework that allows interoperability between functions across
languages, multi-language libraries and package managers, and encoding of
domain specific behavior into the type system. Based on this framework, we will
build a community portal for curating a universal library. Any public functions
in this library can be used in any Morloc script. They may also be imported
into specific languages and used.
